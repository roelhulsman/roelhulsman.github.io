I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/). My PhD is generously funded through the university by Adyen, a Dutch fintech company providing financial technology services, and I spent a minor part of my time at their offices to collaborate with industry scientists. My research largely revolves around causal discovery with a focus on time-series data, but on a bigger scale I find myself interested in fundamental issues on the intersection of machine learning, statistics, econometrics and philosophy.

I graduated from the University of Oxford with a [MSc in Statisticial Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-statistical-science) and from the University of Groningen with a [BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/econometrics-and-operations-research/?lang=en) and a [BA in Philosophy of a Specific Discipline](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/philosophy-of-a-specific-discipline/?lang=en) (in my case the social sciences). At Oxford I was fortunate to be supervised by [Rob Cornish](https://jrmcornish.github.io/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) for my master's dissertation ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14735)) on the analytical distribution of the coverage of a split conformal prediction set. 

Inbetween graduating and joining AMLab, I spend some time at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) as a data analyst for business intelligence, acting as an in-house consultant optimizing business processes through data-driven insights. Afterwards, I moved to a role as researcher in AI for healthcare at the [Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en) in Italy, an independent research institute of the European Commission that supports EU policymaking with evidence-based knowledge and science. Some of my projects there involved biomedical knowledge graph construction with large language models ([link](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3747/text2kg_paper10.pdf)) and conformal risk control for pulmonary nodule detection.
