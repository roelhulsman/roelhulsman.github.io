I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/), supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/) and in collaboration with scientists at [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/nl_NL/), a fintech company providing financial technology services. My research largely revolves around causal discovery with a focus on time-series data. On a larger scale, I am interested in fundamental issues on the intersection of machine learning, statistics, econometrics and philosophy.

I graduated from the University of Oxford with a MSc in Statisticial Science and from the University of Groningen with a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research and a BA in Philosophy of a Specific Discipline (i.e. the social sciences). At Oxford I was fortunate to be supervised by Rob Cornish and Arnaud Doucet for my master's dissertation [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14735) on the distribution of coverage of a split conformal prediction set. Before joining AMLab, I was a researcher in AI for healthcare at the Joint Research Centre in Italy, an independent research institute of the European Commission that supports policymaking with evidence-based knowledge and science. Some of my projects there involved biomedical knowledge graph construction with large language models [link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sergio-Consoli/publication/383422512_On_Constructing_Biomedical_Text-to-Graph_Systems_with_Large_Language_Models/links/66cc8a8c920e05672e506ad3/On-Constructing-Biomedical-Text-to-Graph-Systems-with-Large-Language-Models.pdf) and conformal risk control for pulmonary nodule detection.
