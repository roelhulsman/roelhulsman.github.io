I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/), supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/) and in collaboration with scientists at [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/nl_NL/), a fintech company providing financial technology services. My research largely revolves around causal discovery with a focus on time-series data. On a larger scale, I am interested in fundamental issues on the intersection of machine learning, statistics, econometrics and philosophy.

I graduated from the University of Oxford with a [MSc in Statisticial Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-statistical-science) and from the University of Groningen with a [BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/econometrics-and-operations-research/?lang=en) and a [BA in Philosophy of a Specific Discipline](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/philosophy-of-a-specific-discipline/?lang=en) (in my case the social sciences). At Oxford I was fortunate to be supervised by [Rob Cornish](https://jrmcornish.github.io/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) for my master's dissertation ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14735)) on the distribution of coverage of a split conformal prediction set. Before joining AMLab, I was a researcher in AI for healthcare at the [Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en) in Italy, an independent research institute of the European Commission that supports policymaking with evidence-based knowledge and science. Some of my projects there involved biomedical knowledge graph construction with large language models ([link](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3747/text2kg_paper10.pdf)) and conformal risk control for pulmonary nodule detection.
