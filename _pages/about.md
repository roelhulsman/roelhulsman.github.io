I am a PhD student at the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab ([AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/)) supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/). My PhD is funded by [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/nl_NL/), a Dutch fintech company providing financial technology services, and I spent a minor part of my time at their offices to collaborate with industry scientists. My research largely revolves around causal discovery for time-series, but on a wider scale I find myself interested in fundamental issues on the intersection of machine learning, statistics, econometrics and philosophy.

I graduated from the University of Oxford with a [MSc](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-statistical-science) in Statisticial Science and from the University of Groningen with a [BSc](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/econometrics-and-operations-research/?lang=en) in Econometrics and Operations Research and a [BA](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/philosophy-of-a-specific-discipline/?lang=en) in Philosophy of a Specific Discipline (in my case the social sciences). While in Oxford, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Rob Cornish](https://jrmcornish.github.io/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) for my master's dissertation on the distribution of the coverage of a split conformal prediction set ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14735)). 

Before starting my PhD, I spend a short time at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) as a data analyst for business intelligence, acting as an in-house consultant optimizing business processes through data-driven insights. Afterwards, I moved to a role as researcher in AI for healthcare at the Joint Research Centre ([JRC](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en)) in Italy, an independent research institute of the European Commission that supports EU policymaking through science. Some of my projects there involved biomedical knowledge graph construction with large language models ([link](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3747/text2kg_paper10.pdf)) and conformal risk control for pulmonary nodule detection ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20167)).
